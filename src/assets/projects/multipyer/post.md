Multipyer was created for my A-Level Computer Science coursework (and received an A\*). It was designed to allow beginner
programmers to create online multiplayer games in Python and JavaScript without having to write complex code or set up
their own server.

After creating an account on the Multipyer website, a developer would have access to an online console to create game
servers, leaderboards, and manage player accounts. Then, using the Python and JavaScript libraries, the developer could
create a working multiplayer game in as little as 3 lines of code.

The Multipyer server was created using JavaScript and jQuery on the frontend with a Python backend. The Python and
JavaScript client libraries were written in their own languages.
