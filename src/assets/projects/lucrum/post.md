Designed for personal use during university, Lucrum can import bank transactions, categorising them automatically, and
has a clean modern interface that works on desktop and mobile.

Lucrum was developed to be a free yet full featured alternative to other money management apps, many of which lacked
student-specific features like bill splitting.

The frontend is built using Vue JS JavaScript framework, and is based on Google's Material Design 2 specifications. The
backend is written in Python using Flask, and can be used independently from the frontend as a REST API.
