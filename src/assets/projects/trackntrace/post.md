This was a project that was part of my 'Cloud Application Development' module, for which I received a high 1st.

The backend uses Azure functions, and the site is hosted using Azure storage.

The frontend uses a custom-built JavaScript framework: since we weren't allowed to use
frameworks like Vue or React for this coursework, I decided to make my own.
