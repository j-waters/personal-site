Libellus was created to combine data from many different sources like Google Fit and a bank account, as well as phone and PC usage data. It also supports diary entries and mood tracking.

Its purpose is to act as an automatic diary, and provide insights into how things like sleep patterns and exercise are affected by the day's activities, and how one's mood and productivity changes depending on what apps are used during a day.

The frontend was built using Vue JS, the backend in Python.
