A web based photo viewing and management system, with basic editing capabilities and AI. Fetula can ingest a large
structured photo collection, automatically sorting and tagging each image.

Fetula was designed as a
replacement to Google Photos, keeping its cool AI tricks while working seamlessly with a pre-existing offline photo
collection. Features such as object and facial recognition are not only implemented, but are a lot more transparent and
come with more options.

The frontend was built using Vue JS, trying to mimic the look of Google Photos. The
backend was written in Python with Flask.
